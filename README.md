DESCRIPTION:
This project demonstrates building and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset with scikit-learn.
The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, classified into three species.
We split the data into training and testing sets, train a decision tree model with controlled depth to prevent overfitting, and evaluate it using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
Finally, we visualize the decision tree structure, showing decision splits, feature thresholds, and class predictions, making the modelâ€™s decision-making process interpretable and easy to understand.
